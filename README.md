# NFT Collection Landing Page in React JS

The site is created specifically for the practice of React JS and layout at a more advanced level. The project is a generalization of my knowledge gained after studying React JS at junior level for a long time. To visit the site, click [here](https://tadpoles-club.herokuapp.com/) or click on the link in the __About__ section on github.

__External libraries were used__ during the creation of the site, such as: [React JS CRA](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)__,__ [Typewritter-Effect](https://www.npmjs.com/package/typewriter-effect)__,__ [React-Confetti](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-confetti)__,__ [GSAP](https://greensock.com/gsap/) (for smooth scrolling animation)__,__ [React Use](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-use) and [styled-components](https://styled-components.com/docs/advanced) (used instead of SCSS to save time while creating the site).

__Resources Used in This Project__: [character figures](https://bigheads.io/)__,__ [fonts](https://fontsource.org/) and [svg icons](https://icons8.com/).

This site is a non-commercial one. Made as one of the works for the portfolio :computer:.
